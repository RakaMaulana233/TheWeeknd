            <h1 class="bio-text">The Weeknd is the stage name of Canadian singer, songwriter and record producer Abel Makkonen Tesfaye</h1><hr style="margin-right: 25px;">
            <br>
            <h2 class="bio-text">Childhood & Early Life</h2><br>
            <p>The Weeknd was born to Makkonen and Samra Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, in Scarborough, Ontario. He is the only child of his parents who moved from Ethiopia to Canada in the 1980s.<br>
                He was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, and has no memory of his father leaving the family when he was one or two years old. His mother worked as a nurse and caterer to support the family, attending night school at the same time.<br>
                His first language is Amharic, which he learned from his grandmother. He also became fluent in French from the French immersion classes he attended up to the eighth grade.<br> 
                During his childhood, he attended two schools, West Hill College Institute and Birchmount Park College Institute. However, he was kicked out of one and out of the other after six months. He then left home and began living with two friends in a one bedroom house at 65 Spencer Avenue.</p><br><hr style="margin-right: 25px;">

          <h2>Career</h2><br>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Weeknd's career in music began when he met producer Jeremy Rose. The two immediately started working on an R&B album titled 'The Weekend'. However, the three songs that Tesfaye composed for her, 'What You Need', 'Loft Music' and 'The Morning', were not used by Rose.<br>
            In 2010, Tesfaye created a YouTube channel under the username 'The Weeknd' and uploaded three songs. The songs gained popularity quickly and were also mentioned in blog posts featuring songs by rapper Drake.<br>
            He released his first mixtape, 'House of Balloons', on March 21, 2011. It contains nine tracks, including the songs he composed for Rose. The mixtape was selected as a nominee for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.<br>
